I'm a lifelong learner driven by curiosity and a passion for exploring diverse subjects. My journey spans various fields, and I‚Äôve developed a strong intuition by diving into practical essentials and uncovering the unique nuances of multiple programming languages. I thrive on challenges, especially those requiring niche knowledge, like tinkering with Gradle to build APKs for Android 2.1 Froyo (API level 7 from 2010). I value both breadth and depth, never settling for boredom and always pushing the boundaries of what I can learn and achieve.

[repo](https://github.com/Nircek/ApplicationSieve)
</small>

An app designed to help me categorize and review many applications and find the best ones.

Technologies: Kotlin, Android, SQLite, Kotlin Flows, MVVM architecture

 - Developed an application that allows users to rate and categorize mobile apps, storing results in a structured database.
 - Made use of Kotlin Flows and tried functional approach for efficient data handling and state management.
 - Gained hands-on experience in low-level Bluetooth communication and advanced Android database operations.
 - Designed to solve the challenge of managing a large number of apps after I installed over 1400 and I struggled with that.

Despite encountering hardware limitations (I exceeded upper limit of apps and was forced to hard reset), which resulted in the loss of significant data, I am still eager to continue this project.

</small>

To share my passion for asymmetric encryption, I developed an interactive RSA calculator guiding users through generating RSA public and private keys step-by-step.

Key technologies: JavaScript, Rust, WebAssembly

- Designed with user-friendly features like a one-click ‚Äúyes‚Äù button for fully automated key generation.
- Integrated BigInt support, enabling theoretical key generation of any bit length.
- Built a benchmarking tool to test the efficiency of the key generation algorithm.
- Added SSH and PGP key format outputs, making the calculator useful across various applications.
- Enhanced performance by offloading core calculations to Rust with WebAssembly, letting users toggle between JavaScript and WebAssembly modes to see performance differences in real time.

Multi-Player WebSocket Game - Tic-Tac-Toe on Nine Boards

We developed a multi-player game inspired by Tic-tac-toe, played on nine boards simultaneously. The game allows players to join without registration and operates via a client-server communication protocol using WebSockets.

Key Technologies: Python (asyncio), Bash, WebSockets, Kotlin (mobile), HTML/CSS/JS (web)

My role:
 - Project management: Led and coordinated the entire development process across three repositories (server, mobile app, and website).
 - Communication protocol: Designed and iteratively improved the client-server protocol over WebSockets, ensuring real-time interactions and seamless gameplay across all platforms.
 - Backend development: Built the game server in Python using asyncio, enabling efficient handling of multiple players concurrently.
 - Automation: Wrote Bash scripts to automate the server installation as a service.
